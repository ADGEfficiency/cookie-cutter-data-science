## Setup

Due to the wide variety in options for managing virtual environments, we leave it up to the user to create and activate your virtual environment.

```bash
$ make init
```

## Use

To remove all data and create empty folders:

```bash
$ make init-data
```

Same pattern for models:

```bash
$ make init-models
```
